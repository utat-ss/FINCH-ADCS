CONTENTS OF THIS FILE
---------------------

Here are contained 2 scripts:
- earthmagfield13.m: this is the main code where the computation of the Earth Magnetic Field local components (in Earth centered inertial frame) is carried out
- IGRF13.m: this contains the g and h Gaussian Coefficients from order 1 until order 13

USAGE & TIPS
------------

In order to properly use the two codes take as output:
>> [g,h] = IGRF13
and then use the two matrices in the main code.
