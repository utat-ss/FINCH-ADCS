Orbit Propagator Project
Members: Annalisa, Suraj, Marco, Mingde, Theodora, Afrin, Ria

Task 1: use equations to plot orbital trajectory based on orbital parameters
Task 2: use ODE solvers to numerically solve the differential equation given by the two body problem
Task 3: Implement perturbations into the orbit using one of three methods (Encke, Cowell, Gauss)
